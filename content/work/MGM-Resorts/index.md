I created booking engine prototypes using Framer for mobile and desktop. I customized the protoypes to deliver real dates and rates so test users could get a realistic experience no matter the booking path they chose.

Framer gave us some real performance issues with a years worth of rates in the calendar, but I was able to tune the performance of the app to makeit appear as though it was a real app.
