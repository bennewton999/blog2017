My first role at [@SR_](https://www.sapientrazorfish.com/) (formerly Razorfish) I was on-site at Oakley and help implement Find on-line and pick up in store for Oakley.com on their SAP Hybris Platform.  I helped coordinate the front end development of the e-commerce updates and lead an offshore team, did code reviews and helped with releases.

I worked with designers and Project Managers to formulate estimates.  We implemented new designs for the front end for the cart and checkout pages for desktop and mobile experiences.

I was kept on for the remainder of the year and on site to manage their Front End Team and help with site maintenance leading to the holiday season.

I implemented changes that allowed front end developers to use ES6 and utilize Babel.

I also worked on Oakley's Law Enforcement and Military Site helping add additional commerce functionality.  I worked with SAP Hybris Architects daily and formulated plans as well as helped with releases for both production sites.

* Browserify
