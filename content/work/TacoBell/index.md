I was brought onto this project for only a short period of time.  I was charged with making a reusable component for customizing order item ingredients.  Utilizing a template, I was able to create a system that was populated via JSON either from the back-end or an ajax call and would render a custom menu with many UI effects depending on the properties of the given ingredient.
