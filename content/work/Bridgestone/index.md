On this project, I led the front end development of a new e-commerce section for Bridgestonetire.com and Firestonetire.com.  We added the ability to pick a set of tires and schedule appointments at dealers nation wide.  I led the offshore FED team and designed many aspects of the client side experience.  We implemented an appointment commerce flow that included the ability find a store near you, select tires for your car and schedule an appointment at your selected dealer.  We also added an account section where you could store information about multiple cars, stores and track your appointments.

This was an especially complex project as CSS and JS components needed to be shared between the SAP Hybris and Adobe AEM platforms.

I also lead front end development for the maintenance team for their properties for the year.  This included fixing bugs, implementing new content and new components when necessary and reviewing code.  I lead two small projects which included adding a Winter Olympics section to Bridgestonetire.com with integrated video and adding the ability to find tires by make and model.
