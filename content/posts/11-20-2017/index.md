So here's the obligatory "I'm starting my blog" post.  Only thing is, I sorta started blog over
15 years ago and I never kept it up.  It actually still lives on in the bowels of wordpress.com.
I see it when I have to log in to Gravatar every few year and it's quite embarrassing.
I always had good intentions.

### A New Beginning

So this is it, a new beginning.  I hope to write about, in no particular order,

* My career path to where I am now as a software developer at [SR_](https://sapientrazorfish.com)
* JavaScript Development
* The long and unusual path I took to get where I am now
* And travel (how clich√©)

Yes, if I could, I'd start fresh as a stravel blogger.  Let's see where that ends up.
